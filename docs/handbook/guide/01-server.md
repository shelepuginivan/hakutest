To start the Hakutest server, run `hakutest.exe` (`hakutest` on Linux). An icon
will appear in the system tray to indicate that the server is running:

<img id="systray-icon" src="/logo/icon.svg" alt="Hakutest Icon in system tray" width="96">

After a short timeout (1.5 seconds), Hakutest will open the [Teacher
Dashboard](/handbook/guide/02-dashboard) page.

Click on icon to display the context menu. You can stop server by clicking
"Quit Hakutest", or open the Teacher Dashboard by clicking "Dashboard".
