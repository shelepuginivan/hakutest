## About

**Hakutest** is an educational platform designed for testing in local network. It
allows you to test students, conduct quizzes, and even take exams. In other
words, you can use Hakutest for every task that requires automatic answer
check.

## How it works

Hakutest runs on the local network (but it can also be run on a global network
as well). Each test is represented by a JSON file that is stored locally on
your device. When the Hakutest server is running, students can access the test
through the browser. The platform dynamically generates a web page for each
test, displaying the questions and any additional content specified in the test
file.

Once students have completed the test and submitted their answers, Hakutest
automatically checks their responses against the expected solutions. This
automated answer checking process provides instant feedback to students. The
platform evaluates each answer based on the predefined criteria set in the test
file, allowing for accurate and efficient grading.

By utilizing this approach, Hakutest ensures that the testing process is secure
and reliable. Since the test files are stored locally, the platform maintains
data privacy and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information.
