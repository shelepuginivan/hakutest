# Server

Hakutest web pages, including the test page and test editor, require a running
server.

You can start the Hakutest server using two methods:

-   [By starting the server via graphical Hakutest app](/docs/gui/server)
    (recommended).
-   [By running the `hakutest server` command in a terminal](/docs/cli/server).
