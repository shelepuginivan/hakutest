# Test page

The test page allows student to solve the test and submit their answers.

When the server is running, it can be accessed from any device in the local network at the following URL:

`http://<local-ip-of-your-device>:<port>/<name-of-the-test-file>`

Where:

-   `local-ip-of-your-device` - The local IP address of the device running the Hakutest server.

:::

-   `port` - The port on which server is listening (see [Server configuration](/docs/configuration/server#port)).
-   `name-of-the-test-file` - Filename of the test you want to access. The test file should be placed in the tests directory (see [General configuration](/docs/configuration/general#tests_directory)).

### Example

Let's assume that:

-   The local IP of your device is `192.168.1.34`.
-   The port on which the server is running is `8080`.
-   The `tests` directory is located in the `./data/tests`
-   The `tests` directory contains the `my-test.json` file.

```txt title='Directory structure'
hakutest/
    hakutest(.exe)
    data/
        tests/
            my-test.json
```

In this example, when the server is running, you can access the test `my-test` at http://192.168.1.34:8080/my-test.

:::note

Test file extension (`.json`) can be omitted.

In the example above, both URLs point to `my-test`:

-   http://192.168.1.34:8080/my-test
-   http://192.168.1.34:8080/my-test.json
