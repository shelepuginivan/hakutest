# Introducing Hakutest - A Reliable and Efficient Educational Testing Platform

I am excited to announce the first release (version 0.1.0) of Hakutest - an educational testing platform designed with your needs in mind. It aims to revolutionize the educational testing experience, offering a seamless and intuitive solution for educators and students alike.

Let's explore the core concepts that differentiate Hakutest from the existing solutions:

-   **Data Privacy**: Hakutest prioritizes safeguarding sensitive information. All data is stored locally, ensuring that no personal or confidential data is exposed to corporations or unauthorized individuals.

-   **High Performance**: Hakutest is built to be blazingly fast, capable of automatically checking students' answers in a matter of milliseconds, and even microseconds. This instant feedback allows for real-time evaluation, making the grading process accurate and efficient.

-   **Free and Open Source**: Hakutest is completely free and open source, providing the best testing experience for everyone.

-   **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Hakutest is designed to be accessible to everyone, regardless of their environment. Our platform supports Linux, Windows, and macOS, ensuring that educators and students can easily access and utilize Hakutest on their preferred devices.

-   **Customizable and Accessible**: Hakutest is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Every educational institution has unique requirements. That's why the platform allows for easy configuration of behavior and supports internationalization, enabling educators to tailor the testing experience to their specific needs.

Now, let's dive into how Hakutest works. Each test is represented by a JSON file stored locally on your computer. When the Hakutest server is running, students can access the test through the web browser. Hakutest dynamically generates a web page for each test, displaying the questions and any additional content specified in the test file.

Once students have completed the test and submitted their answers, Hakutest automatically checks their responses against the expected solutions. This automated answer checking process provides instant feedback, allowing students to assess their performance immediately. Our platform evaluates each answer based on the predefined criteria set in the test file, ensuring accurate and efficient grading.

By utilizing this approach, Hakutest ensures that the testing process is secure, reliable, and convenient. Since the test files are stored locally, the platform maintains data privacy and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information.

To get started with Hakutest, I invite you to explore the [documentation](/docs/intro) and [installation guide](/docs/installation). These resources will guide you through the setup process, ensuring a seamless transition to a more efficient and reliable testing experience.
