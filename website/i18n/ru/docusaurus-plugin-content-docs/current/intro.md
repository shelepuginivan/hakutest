### About Hakutest

Hakutest is an educational platform designed for testing. It allows you to test students, conduct quizzes, and even take exams. In other words, you can use Hakutest for every task that requires automatic answer check.

It has a number of advantages over its analogues:

-   **Security**: Your data and your students' data are stored locally, ensuring that no one else can access it.
-   **Efficiency**: Hakutest is an efficient system capable of checking students' answers in a matter of milliseconds.
-   **Customizability**: You can customize the system to suit your needs: internationalization, different environments, data export and more.
-   **Cross-platform**: Prebuilt packages are available for Windows, Linux and macOS.
-   **Free**: Hakutest is a free and open source software.

### Motivation

Today, numerous testing systems are available for educational institutions. However, each of them has significant drawbacks. Some of them have security issues: they compromise answers or allow students to falsify their results. Some of them are proprietary, so student data is stored on third-party servers. Hakutest was created with the intention to mitigate these weaknesses and provide the best testing experience for both students and teachers.

### How it works

In Hakutest, each test is represented by a JSON file that is stored locally on your computer. When the Hakutest server is running, students can access the test through the browser. The platform dynamically generates a web page for each test, displaying the questions and any additional content specified in the test file.

Once students have completed the test and submitted their answers, Hakutest automatically checks their responses against the expected solutions. This automated answer checking process provides instant feedback to students. The platform evaluates each answer based on the predefined criteria set in the test file, allowing for accurate and efficient grading.

By utilizing this approach, Hakutest ensures that the testing process is secure and reliable. Since the test files are stored locally, the platform maintains data privacy and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information.
